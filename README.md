# Welcome to my Excel Read Project
This project was created to read data in excel format that pertains to my job at UPS, it takes all of the flight data for January 2024, and outputs the average delay for each day in the month in a Windows Form Application. 
# Requirements:
This project requires Microsoft Excel 2021 and Visual Studio 2022, with the .NET 8.0 framework.
# Instructions: 
Download the folder named: "Excel Read Project", then copy the file "FlightSearchResults.xlsx" to your computer. Once open in visual studio, all you must do is press the play button at the top to run the code.
# How it was made:
Language used: C#
I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 to create this Windows Form Application, with functions to read the data in excel, and output the desired data in a visually appealing format. All code is executed once the button is clicked.
